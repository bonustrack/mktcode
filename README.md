### About Me

[![Mktcodes's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mktcode&show_icons=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I have been a software developer for 15 years. I have worked as a freelancer and in different companies. I have always been able to choose my job and can't remember ever being turned down after an interview. I am quite an all-rounder and am always good to very good at everything I do. I learn quickly when I want to. I have a superpower. It's called enthusiasm! Actually, by now I should be relatively settled in life and financially independent. I only have one problem. I am creative. And I die when I have to surpress it. I've never worked in the same job for more than a year or two, sometimes only a few months. It just bores me. I can't work according to a certain routine and certainly not in a team with others. I've been told so many times to at least make a compromise. I could work part-time, switch off my brain and soul, and then have the rest of the time for myself. But I can't do it. It just doesn't work and I have given up by now. I'm currently without a job and I'm certainly not trying to change that. But I work more than in any other job before and luckily I live in Germany where we have unemployment benefits. That's currently the best setup I can find. Taking a lousy "salary" for work that companies would actually pay quite well for. But I refuse and prefer the freedom for my mind. That won't work for long either, because they won't allow me forever to do work that I myself consider meaningful. That is for others to decide for me. For now I will just "hack the system" kind of by letting the tax payer unknowingly pay for Open Source development. And I won't listen to people calling me lazy or a burden for society. They just don't know shit.

I am now working on something that I enjoy and am excited about and that might also be useful for others as well. I call it [Crypto Workflows](https://crypto-workflows.github.io), because it's about integrating Ethereum-based payments directly into CI/CD workflows. I don't really know where this is going yet, but the potential seems quite big.
