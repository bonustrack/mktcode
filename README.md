# About Me

I've been a software developer for 15 years now. I have worked as a freelancer and in different companies. I am quite an all-rounder and I learn quickly if I really want to, because I have a superpower. Enthusiasm! Actually, by now I should be relatively settled in life and financially independent. But my superpower is accompanied by a curse. I love to be creative and work on my own ideas and I die when I have to surpress it. I've never worked in the same job for more than a year or two, sometimes only a few months. I have huge problems with following a routine and being told what to work on. I could just work part-time, switch off my brain and soul, and then I'd have the rest of the time for myself. But I can't do it. It just doesn't work. At least not for long. I've tried many times. Starting my own business also failed, kind of, because there are rules and limitations as well and I needed others to take care of... well... the business part and I'm just not a great teamplayer and it wasn't really my ambition to begin with. So, after creating the idea and building the foundation, I left the project. And that's basically what I want to do. I want to play and learn, generate ideas, build prototypes and of course contribute to all sorts of projects I come across. **Long story short, I want to be a full-time free and open source developer, where "free and open" also refers to me as a person and not just the code.** Is that a bit delusionary and likely to fail? Probably. Am I ignorant enough to try anyway. Absolutely. And for that very reason my work will often times be somehow related to that topic. Take a look at the pinned projects below to get a notion of what I mean.
