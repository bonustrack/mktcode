### About Me

**Disclaimer: I'm a creative person who sometimes just enjoys writing. What you are about to read is just a snapshot in time. I do not actually know who I am and what to believe.**

I've been a software developer for 15 years now. I have worked as a freelancer and in different companies. I have always been able to choose my job and I can't remember ever being turned down after an interview. I am quite an all-rounder and I am always pretty good at everything I do. I learn quickly if I really want to, because I have a superpower. It's called enthusiasm! I hope that didn't sound too arrogrant but what I want to say is, you can become good at everything as long as you are enthusiastic about it. Actually, by now I should be relatively settled in life and financially independent. But my superpower is accompanied by a curse. I love to be creative. And I die when I have to surpress it. I've never worked in the same job for more than a year or two, sometimes only a few months. It just bores me. I can't work according to a certain routine and certainly not on somebody else's ideas, in a team with others, especially not when I realize they are just playing roles and do whatever the boss or some social convention tells them to do.

I've been told so many times to at least make a compromise. I could work part-time, switch off my brain and soul, and then have the rest of the time for myself. But I can't do it. It just doesn't work and I have given up by now. I'm currently without a job and I'm certainly not trying to change that. But I work more than in any other job before and luckily I live in Germany where we have unemployment benefits. That's currently the best setup I can find. Taking a lousy "salary" for work that companies would actually pay quite well for. But I refuse that and prefer the freedom for my mind. That won't work for long either, because they won't allow me forever to do work that I myself consider meaningful. That is for others to decide for me. The alternative is to start my own business and I tried. But building a business again comes with its own rules and I just couldn't do it and so I left the project.

For now I will just let the tax payer unknowingly pay for the Open Source work I do and I won't listen to people calling me lazy or a burden for society. They just don't know shit. Why don't they complain about those giant corps taking aid money from them and then forwarding it as dividends to their stake holders? I guess it is always easier to bitch about the neighbor than to face fundamental problems. I understand how people are all to often driven by fear and just want to belong somewhere, to some group, be it a football club, a political party or some activists group or conspiracy theories or just by identifying with a certain set of values. I've been an outsider all my life and I never felt that urge to be a part of any group with more than two or three people. But I identify myself as an honest person, an open source developer and I don't like many aspects of modern civilization and that resonates with some people while others reject that view. So there's my peer group, I guess. I'm not embittered but there are things that make me sad sometimes. And yet I am basically of very positive and optimistic nature and just enjoy life without worrying too much.

I am now working on something that I enjoy and am excited about and that might also be useful for others. I call it [Crypto Workflows](https://crypto-workflows.github.io), because it's about integrating crypto payments directly into CI/CD workflows.
