### About Me

I've been a software developer for 15 years now. I have worked as a freelancer and in different companies. I am quite an all-rounder and I learn quickly if I really want to, because I have a superpower. Enthusiasm! Actually, by now I should be relatively settled in life and financially independent. But my superpower is accompanied by a curse. I love to be creative and work on my own ideas and I die when I have to surpress it. I've never worked in the same job for more than a year or two, sometimes only a few months. I have huge problems with following a routine and being told what to work on. I could just work part-time, switch off my brain and soul, and then I'd have the rest of the time for myself. But I can't do it. It just doesn't work. At least not for long. I've tried many times. Starting my own business also failed, kind of, because there are rules and limitations as well and I needed others to take care of that and then I'm just not a great teamplayer and a bit difficult at times. After creating the idea and building the foundation, I (more or less) left the project. And actually that's all I want to do. Basically I just want to play and learn, generate ideas, build prototypes and of course contribute to all sorts of projects I like. **Long story short, I want to be a full-time free and open source developer, without any obligations.**

**I am now working on something that I enjoy and am excited about and that might also be useful for others. I call it [Crypto Workflows](https://crypto-workflows.github.io). It's about integrating crypto payments directly into CI/CD workflows.**
