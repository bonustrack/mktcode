### About Me

[![Mktcodes's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mktcode&show_icons=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I have been a software developer for 15 years. I have worked as a freelancer and in different companies. I have always been able to choose my job and can't remember ever being turned down after an interview. I am quite an all-rounder and am always good to very good at everything I do. I learn quickly when I want to. Actually, by now I should be relatively settled in life and financially independent. I only have one problem. I am creative. And I die when I can't live that out. I've never worked in the same job for more than a year or two, sometimes only a few months. It just bores me. I can't work according to a certain routine and certainly not in a team with others. If I then notice that my colleagues are just playing roles and not really being themselves, then I'm out. I've been told so many times to at least make a compromise. I could work part-time, switch off my brain and soul, and then have the rest of the time to myself. But I just can't do it. Not even for one hour could I work on something that is not mine and does not inspire me when my brain is in the process of developing other ideas. It just doesn't work. I have given up in the meantime. I am unemployed, live on welfare and drink too much. But I work more than in any job before. I'm not one hundred percent happy either, but under no circumstances will I ever try to adapt and get a regular job again. Especially not in a society where the majority of people don't have the courage to do anything other than follow orders. Sorry, but I'm out of that. Of course, it's not really the people themselves who are to blame. It is probably the greed for profit and power of a few pathologically unsympathetic people that is continuously slowing down and misguiding our civilisation. The people I meet on the street are mostly good-hearted, just trying to find their place, but unfortunately also unable to see the big picture and understand why this "modern" life sometimes feels like the only meaning is to work and earn money.

I am now working on something that I enjoy and am excited about and that might also be useful for others as well. I call it [Crypto Workflows](https://crypto-workflows.github.io), because it's about integrating Ethereum-based payments directly into CI/CD workflows. I don't really know where this is going yet, but the potential seems quite big.

If you want to support me, and I don't necessarily mean the code I write but really me as a person, here is my Ethereum address: 0x27711f9c07230632F2EE1A21a967a9AC4729E520
